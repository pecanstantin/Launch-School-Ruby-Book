# You run the following code...

names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

# ...and get the following error message:

#TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
 # from (irb):2:in `[]='
 # from (irb):2
 # from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

 # What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

 # You are attempting to set the value of an item in an array using a string as the key. 
 # Arrays are indexed with integers, not strings. 
 # You would modify the array by doing the following:
  
 names[3] = 'jody'
 # => ["bob", "joe", "susan", "jody"]
