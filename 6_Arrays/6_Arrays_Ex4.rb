# What does each method return in the following example?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)
# .index returns the index of the first instance of the argument provided
# so it returns 3

2. arr.index[5]
# error, since .index already returns an index, and we're giving it an index
# with square brackets here

3. arr[5]
# 8
