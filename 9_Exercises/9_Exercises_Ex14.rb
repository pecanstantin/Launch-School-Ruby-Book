# 14. Take the following array:

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

# and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
# (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. 
# Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.

a = a.map { |x| x.split }
a = a.flatten
puts a

#irb doesn't display the new array correctly but it is right
